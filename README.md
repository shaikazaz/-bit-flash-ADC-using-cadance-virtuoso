### Power-Efficient 4-Bit Flash ADC for Biomedical Applications  

Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) play a crucial role in various applications such as biomedical devices, data storage read channels, and optical receivers by bridging real-world analog signals with digital processing systems. This project focuses on designing a power-efficient 4-bit Flash ADC tailored for biomedical applications.  

Key enhancements in this design include replacing the conventional R-2R ladder with a sample-and-hold circuit to minimize power consumption. Additionally, a simplified comparator is utilized instead of the traditional design, and a priority encoder is integrated as an alternative to a standard encoder. The ADC is implemented using 0.18Î¼m CMOS technology, with CADENCE VIRTUOSO tools employed for schematic design and simulation. The simulated results demonstrate an **analog input range of 1.8V** at a **frequency of 33.20MHz**, showcasing the efficiency of the proposed architecture.
